                        Although they might seem very different, I was constantly mesmerized whenever I thought how both worlds would continuously bring complexity to a whole new level, and yet making it feel much more simple, effortless and enjoyable every time.<br><br>
                        
                        I started designing around 2015, and I’m still learning something new every single day. I’m actively looking for an internship, or an entry-level UX job to keep growing.<br><br>
