                        <h1 class="am-trigger2">Hi! I'm <strong>Roy</strong>. I was born in Madrid, <strong>Spain</strong>, and since I was a kid, I was in love with two things: gymnastics and technology. Mainly, because of how effortless and enjoyable they seemed to be, while "hiding" a great level of underlying complexity.<br><br>

                            I got a degree in <strong>Sport Sciences</strong> in 2014, and for a few years I spent most of my time trying to become the best athlete I could be, which was fun. Nowadays you cand find me either in tech hackathons with one of my best friends, hanging out with my practice group, or trying to make a responsive UX portfolio in the 1st try... or at the 726th one.<br><br>
                            
                            All in all, I started designing around 2015, and still learning something new every single day. <strong>I’m actively looking for an internship, or an entry-level UX job</strong> in order to keep growing.<br><br>
