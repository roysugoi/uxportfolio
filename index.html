                    <h1 class="am-trigger2">Hi! My name is Rodrigo, but everyone calls me <strong>Roy</strong>. I was born in <strong>Madrid, Spain</strong>, and since I was a kid, I was in love with two things: gymnastics and technology, mainly because of how effortless and enjoyable they became while rising the level of its underlying complexity.<br><br>

                        I got a degree in <strong>Sport Sciences</strong> in 2014, and for a few years I spent most of my time trying to become the best athlete I could be, which was fun. Nowadays you cand find me either in tech hackathons with one of my best friends, upside down every time I go practice, or making weird noises every time virtualy any animal crosses my way.<br><br>
                        
                        All in all, I started designing around 2015, and still learning something new every single day. I’m actively <strong>looking for an internship, or an entry-level UX job</strong> in order to keep growing.<br><br>
