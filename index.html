                    <h1 class="am-trigger2">Hi! I’m Rodrigo, but kids had a really hard time trying to spell the “dr” in my name, so now everyone calls me <strong>Roy</strong>. I was born in <strong>Madrid, Spain</strong>, and since I was a kid, I was in love with two things: gymnastics and technology.<br><br>

                        Although they might seem very different, I was constantly mesmerized whenever I thought how both worlds would continuously bring complexity to a whole new level, and yet making it feel much more simple, effortless and enjoyable every time.<br><br>
                        
                        So, I had to decide! I ended up getting a degree in <strong>Sports Sciences</strong> in 2014, and shortly after I graduated, I discovered tech hackathons thanks to a friend of mine. I absolutely love them, and they made me realize how badly I wanted to become a UX designer. And here I am.<br><br>
                        
                        I’m still learning something new every single day, and I’m actively looking for an internship, or an entry-level UX job to keep growing.<br><br>
